Python Steganography Project

   :alt: Steganography Image

This Python project aims to implement steganography techniques to hide encoded messages within images. Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within other non-secret data to avoid detection. In this case, we'll be hiding messages within image files.

How it works
------------

The steganography process involves embedding the encoded message within the least significant bits (LSB) of the pixel values in an image. By modifying these bits, the changes are not visible to the human eye but can be extracted programmatically. The receiver can then extract the hidden message from the image.

Installation
------------

To use this steganography tool, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. Clone this repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/ShiroTsuma-github/PYTHON_STEGANOGRAPHY.git
   cd PYTHON_STEGANOGRAPHY
   pip install -r requirements.txt
